**Docker:-**

Docker is Containerisation Plarform Which Packages Our Application Code and It's All Dependencies Together In The Form of Containers. 

So That We Can Ensure That Our Application Works Seamlessly in Any Environment. Through the Docker Platform We Can Develop, Shipping, Managing, Scalling and Running Applications. 

Docker Package = Application Code + Application Dependenices + Runtime OS 

**Advantages of Containers:-**

Portability:-        We Can Develop, Manage, Run and Shipping of Applications in the Form Containers is Very Easy.

Lightweight:         Containers Are Light Weight. Containers Share the host OS kernel, Unlike Virtual Machines Which Each Require Their Own OS. By These We Can Achieve Faster start-up times. Lower resource usage.

Scalability:-        Containers are Highly Scalable and Work Seamlessly With Orchestration Tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. Easy to Scale In and Out Based On Demand With Load Balancing.

Rapid Deployment:-   Containers Enable Faster & More Reliable Deployments Through Consistent Environments.

Uniformity Across Environments:- Developers, Testers, and Operations (SRE) Teams Use The Same Container Image Throughout the SDLC. Reduces Environment Drift and Misconfigurations.


Comparison With Micro Services and Monolithic Deployments:-

A Monolithic Application is Built as a Single Unified Unit Where as a Microservices Architecture is a Collection of Smaller, Independently Deployable Services In The Form of Containers.
